Initial NTP-Status integration include file.

This currently supports the standard ntpd package and as well as the enhanced Linux one (where ntpq has a wide option). Needs more testing across OSes

Requiers bash, will not work with default Bourne or Korn shells as it requires bash specific extensions.

The PATH environment variable is defined as most users do not have ntpq in their default path.

NTPHOST can be defined to query a remote host. Default is a localhost connection.

Included file priority will need to be checked.

TODO:
* Windows support for Meinberg NTPD
* Chrony support (Different sampler)
